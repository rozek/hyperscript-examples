# hyperscript-examples #

a (growing) list of \_hyperscript examples

[\_hyperscript](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/_hyperscript) is a relatively new programming language and, thus, lacks comprehensive documentation, tutorials and examples.

This repository shall narrow this gap a bit by providing a (growing) number of hopefull useful examples.

### evaluate ###

If you want to implement a \_hyperscript REPL or a "message box" like in HyperCard, LiveCode or similar, you need a mechanism to evaluate \_hyperscript code at runtime. One solution (perhaps not the best one) is to prepend the following script element before the \_hyperscript runtime itself:

```
 <script type="text/hyperscript">
  def evaluate (Script)
    createElement('div') on document then set Incubator to it
      js (Script)
        return Script.replace(/&/g,'&amp;').replace(/\x22/g,'&quot;')
      end
      put it into Script

      put `
        <div style="display:none" _="
          init
            ${Script}
          end
        "></div>
      ` into the innerHTML of Incubator
    get the first <div/> in Incubator then set auxDiv to it
      put auxDiv after document.body      -- actually evaluates the given script
    remove auxDiv
  end
 </script>
```

You may then evaluate some \_hyperscript code given in text form using

```
 evaluate('call alert("Hello from evaluated _hyperscript!")')
```

provided that the given code fits into the `init` section of the `_` attribute for a (temporary) HTML element.
